Abstract:
Rendering to their abilities to provide ubiquitous connectivity, flexibly and cost effectively, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been getting more and more research attention.
To take the UAVs' performance to the next level, however, they need to be merged with some other technologies like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter wave (mmWave), which both promise high spectral efficiency (SE). As
managing UAVs efficiently may not be possible using model-based techniques, another key innovative technology that UAVs will inevitably need to leverage is artificial intelligence (AI). Designing
an AI-based technique that adaptively allocates radio resources and places UAVs in 3D space to meet certain communication objectives, however, is a tough row to hoe. In this paper,
we propose a neuroevolution of augmenting topologies NEAT framework, referred to as ProSky, to manage NOMA-mmWave-UAV networks. ProSky exhibits a remarkable performance im-
provement over a model-based method. Moreover, ProSky learns 5.3 times faster than and outperforms, in both SE and energy efficiency EE while being reasonably fair, a deep reinforcement
learning DRL based scheme.
